### Known Issues
1. Bundle components are hardcoded in server.py - should read from Excel
2. No visual indicator distinguishing bundle products from regular products
3. Component sequence numbers not visually indicated

### Recommendations
1. Add bundle icon to distinguish bundle products
2. Show component sequence numbers
3. Add component count badge on collapsed bundles
4. Implement dynamic loading from ProductRelatedComponent sheet
