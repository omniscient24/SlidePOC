# Deletion Persistence Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Tech catalog no longer showing hierarchy**
   - Root cause: Data filtering or loading issues

2. **Corp catalog reappearing after deletion**
   - Root cause: Hierarchy always reads from Excel files, not from Salesforce
   - Deletions only affect Salesforce, not the source Excel files
   - Every page reload shows Excel data, so deleted items reappear

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Deletion Tracking System
- Added `/data/deleted_items.json` to track deleted items locally
- Structure:
  ```json
  {
    "deletedItems": {
      "catalogs": ["id1", "id2"],
      "categories": ["id3", "id4"],
      "products": ["id5", "id6"]
    },
    "lastUpdated": "2025-07-24T..."
  }
  ```

### 2. Updated Product Hierarchy Handler
- Loads deleted items list on every hierarchy request
- Filters out deleted items when building hierarchy from Excel
- Applies filtering at all levels:
  - Catalogs
  - Categories  
  - Products

### 3. Updated Commit Handler
- When deletion succeeds in Salesforce:
  - Adds item ID to deleted_items.json
  - Categorizes by type (catalog/category/product)
  - Updates timestamp
  - Persists to disk

### 4. Code Changes

#### In handle_get_product_hierarchy():
```python
# Load deleted items
deleted_items = set()
if os.path.exists(deleted_items_path):
    with open(deleted_items_path, 'r') as f:
        deleted_data = json.load(f)
        for category in deleted_data.get('deletedItems', {}).values():
            deleted_items.update(category)

# Skip deleted items when building hierarchy
if catalog_id in deleted_items:
    continue
```

#### In handle_commit_changes():
```python
# Track successful deletions
if success:
    # Add to deleted items tracking
    if node_type == 'catalog':
        deleted_data['deletedItems']['catalogs'].append(node_id)
    # Save back to file
    with open(deleted_items_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(deleted_data, f, indent=2)
```

## How It Works

1. User deletes item in UI
2. Deletion is committed to Salesforce
3. If successful, item ID is added to deleted_items.json
4. On next hierarchy load:
   - Excel data is loaded as usual
   - Deleted items are filtered out
   - UI shows current state (without deleted items)

## Limitations & Future Improvements

1. **Current Limitations**:
   - Deleted items list grows indefinitely
   - No sync back to Excel files
   - Manual cleanup needed if items are restored

2. **Future Improvements**:
   - Implement proper data source switching (Excel vs Salesforce)
   - Update Excel files after successful deletions
   - Add "sync from Salesforce" to refresh Excel data
   - Implement soft delete with restore capability
   - Add cleanup for old deleted items

## Testing

1. Delete a catalog (e.g., Corp catalog)
2. Refresh the page
3. Deleted catalog should not reappear
4. Check `/data/deleted_items.json` to verify tracking
