# DCS Bundle ID Fix Summary

## Date: July 29, 2025

### Issue Identified
- **Problem**: DCS bundles were not showing child components while HRM bundles were working correctly
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded bundle IDs in server.py didn't match the actual IDs in the data
- **User Report**: "The Data Classification bundles are not showing child components, however the Human Risk Management bundle child components are appearing"

### Investigation Results
The bundle IDs in server.py were outdated:
- Old (incorrect) IDs:
  - DCS Essentials Bundle: `01tdp000006HfphAAC`
  - DCS Advanced Bundle: `01tdp000006HfpiAAC`
  - DCS Elite Bundle: `01tdp000006HfpjAAC`

The actual IDs from the API response:
- New (correct) IDs:
  - DCS Essentials Bundle: `01tdp000006JEGlAAO`
  - DCS Advanced Bundle: `01tdp000006JEGjAAO`
  - DCS Elite Bundle: `01tdp000006JEGkAAO`

### Fix Applied
Updated both occurrences of `bundle_mappings` in server.py (lines 1853 and 2049) with the correct DCS bundle IDs.

### Verification
After restarting the server, all DCS bundles now correctly display their components:

1. **DCS Essentials Bundle** (3 components):
   - DCS for Windows
   - Data Detection Engine
   - DCS Getting Started Package

2. **DCS Advanced Bundle** (5 components):
   - DCS for Windows
   - Data Detection Engine
   - DCS Admin Console
   - DCS Analysis Collector
   - DCS for OWA

3. **DCS Elite Bundle** (7 components):
   - DCS for Windows
   - Data Detection Engine
   - DCS Admin Console
   - DCS Analysis Collector
   - DCS for OWA
   - Unlimited Classification
   - Software Development Kit

### Complete Bundle Fix Summary
This fix completes the bundle component display issues:
1. Fixed component column positioning (previously fixed)
2. Added bundle data to Excel workbook (previously fixed)
3. Fixed DCS bundle ID mismatch (this fix)

All bundle products now correctly show their child components in the Product Hierarchy visualization.

### Testing
- API response verified via curl commands
- Visual test page at `/test-bundle-visual.html` can be used to verify all bundles
- All 6 bundles (3 DCS + 3 HRM) now display components correctly
