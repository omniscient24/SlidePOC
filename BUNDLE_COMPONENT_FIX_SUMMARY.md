# Bundle Component Display Fix Summary

## Date: July 28, 2025

### Issues Fixed

1. **Component Column Positioning Error**
   - **Problem**: Bundle components were not appearing in the "Bundle Components" column
   - **Root Cause**: Incorrect formula for calculating component X position
   - **Fix**: Updated formula in `product-hierarchy.html` line 1680 from:
     ```javascript
     node.x = (1 + categoryDepth + 2) * columnWidth;
     ```
     to:
     ```javascript
     node.x = (2 + maxCatDepth + 2) * columnWidth;
     ```

2. **Missing Bundle Data in Excel**
   - **Problem**: ProductRelatedComponent relationships were hardcoded in server.py but missing from Excel
   - **Root Cause**: Bundle mappings were not exported to the Excel workbook
   - **Fix**: Created `fix_bundle_data.py` script that:
     - Added 27 bundle component relationships to ProductRelatedComponent sheet
     - Marked 6 products as bundles in Product2 sheet
     - Preserved existing data while adding new bundle mappings

### Files Modified

1. **templates/product-hierarchy.html**
   - Fixed component positioning logic to use max category depth
   - Components now correctly appear in the "Bundle Components" column

2. **data/Revenue_Cloud_Complete_Upload_Template.xlsx**
   - Added 27 rows to 25_ProductRelatedComponent sheet
   - Added IsBundle column to 13_Product2 sheet

### Test Results

Before fix:
- Components appeared in SUB-CATEGORY column (column 3)
- No bundle data in Excel workbook

After fix:
- Components now appear in BUNDLE COMPONENTS column (column 5 or 6 depending on hierarchy depth)
- Excel workbook contains complete bundle-component relationships

### How to Test

1. Start the server: `python start.py`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/product-hierarchy
3. Look for bundle products (e.g., "DCS Essentials Bundle", "HRM Advanced Bundle")
4. Click the expand button (+) on a bundle product
5. Verify components appear in the rightmost "Bundle Components" column

### Bundle Products in System

**DCS Bundles:**
- DCS Essentials Bundle (3 components)
- DCS Advanced Bundle (5 components)
- DCS Elite Bundle (7 components)

**HRM Bundles:**
- HRM Essentials Bundle (2 components)
- HRM Advanced Bundle (4 components)
- HRM Elite Bundle (6 components)

### Next Steps

1. Test all bundle products to ensure components display correctly
2. Verify component drag-and-drop functionality
3. Ensure changes persist through commit operations
4. Consider adding visual indicators for bundle products (e.g., bundle icon)
