# Session Summary: Product Hierarchy Visualization Fixes
**Date**: January 23, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on fixing multiple issues in the Product Hierarchy visualization tool, particularly around bundle components display, node overlap, text wrapping, and column header alignment.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Bundle Components Column Incorrect Display
**Problem**: All products were appearing in the Bundle Components column instead of only actual bundle components.

**Root Cause**: 
- Products were being processed twice - once in special handling and again in normal processing
- Missing `_positioned` flag to track which nodes had already been positioned

**Solution**:
- Added `_positioned` flag to mark nodes that have been specially positioned
- Ensured bundle components (children of products) are properly filtered and positioned in the correct column
- Fixed column calculation for components: `(1 + categoryDepth + 2) * columnWidth`

### 2. Node Overlap When Expanding/Collapsing
**Problem**: Nodes were overlapping when expanding or collapsing hierarchy levels, particularly in the Product column.

**Root Causes**:
- Fixed spacing (`index * nodeHeight`) didn't include gaps between nodes
- No collision detection during layout or drag operations
- Manual Y positions weren't being reset when hierarchy changed

**Solutions**:
- Implemented 15px spacing between all nodes
- Created `preventOverlaps()` function to ensure minimum spacing
- Added collision detection in drag behavior
- Reset `_manualY` positions when expanding/collapsing nodes

### 3. Text Not Wrapping / Nodes Too Small
**Problem**: Long node titles were being cut off instead of wrapping, and nodes weren't expanding to accommodate wrapped text.

**Solutions**:
- Created `calculateTextHeight()` function to measure required height for wrapped text
- Made node rectangles dynamically sized based on text content
- Updated all spacing calculations to use actual node heights
- Ensured text wrapping is reapplied when nodes are updated

### 4. Column Header Misalignment
**Problem**: Column headers became misaligned when bundle components were expanded, not matching the actual node positions.

**Root Cause**:
- Column detection was recalculating positions instead of using actual node X coordinates
- Headers were updated before node transitions completed
- Static column definitions didn't adapt to dynamic hierarchy depth

**Solutions**:
- Changed to use `Math.round(d.x / columnWidth)` for column detection
- Created dynamic `getColumnInfo()` function that adapts to actual structure
- Synchronized header updates with transition end events
- Always rebuild headers to ensure proper alignment

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- Bundle products now appear first in the Product column
- Expand/collapse buttons properly positioned at right edge of nodes
- Hierarchy starts collapsed (only root and catalog visible)
- Products properly centered around their parent nodes

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Functions Added/Modified:
1. **`calculateTextHeight(textString, width)`** - Calculates required height for wrapped text
2. **`preventOverlaps(nodes)`** - Ensures minimum spacing between nodes
3. **`getColumnInfo(column)`** - Dynamically determines column labels and colors
4. **Collision detection in drag behavior** - Prevents manual overlap during drag

### Important Variables:
- `nodeHeight = 60` (base height)
- `nodeWidth = 180`
- `columnWidth = 250`
- `15px` spacing between nodes
- `_positioned` flag to track specially positioned nodes
- `_manualY` flag for manually dragged nodes
- `_height` stored on node data for dynamic heights

## Testing Performed
- ✅ Bundle components only show actual components
- ✅ No node overlap when expanding/collapsing
- ✅ Text wraps properly in all nodes
- ✅ Node heights expand for long text
- ✅ Column headers stay aligned
- ✅ Drag behavior prevents overlap
- ✅ Bundle products appear first in Product column
- ✅ Hierarchy starts collapsed

## Files Modified
- `/Users/marcdebrey/cpq-revenue-cloud-migration/POC/templates/product-hierarchy.html` - Main visualization template with all fixes

## Next Steps
1. Continue with Phase 2 of edit functionality implementation
2. Add keyboard navigation support
3. Implement search/filter functionality
4. Add export capabilities for the visualization
