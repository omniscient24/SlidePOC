# Sync Display Refactoring - Complete

## Overview
Successfully refactored the Data Management -> Sync Data tab to provide a clean, professional display of Revenue Cloud objects with status tracking and workbook management capabilities.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Table-Based Display
- **Clean table layout** showing all Revenue Cloud objects
- **Columns**: Select, Object Name, API Name, Status, Last Synced, Records, Actions
- **Visual status badges** with color coding:
  - ✓ Synced (green)
  - × Not Synced (red)
  - ⟳ Syncing (blue)
  - ⏳ Pending (orange)
  - ⚠ Error (red)

### 2. Individual Object Actions
Each object row now has three action links:
- **View** - Preview workbook data in a modal
- **Download** - Download object data as Excel file
- **Sync** - Sync individual object

### 3. Enhanced Sync Progress
- **Overall progress bar** with percentage
- **Detailed progress table** showing:
  - Object name
  - Current status
  - Individual progress bars
- **Real-time status updates** during sync

### 4. Workbook Preview Modal
- **Pop-up modal** showing first 100 records
- **Scrollable table** with all fields
- **Download button** in modal header
- **Record count** display

### 5. Status Persistence
- **LocalStorage** saves sync status between sessions
- **Last synced timestamps** with relative time display:
  - "5 min ago"
  - "2 hours ago"
  - Full date for older syncs
- **Record counts** preserved after sync

### 6. Bulk Operations
- **Select All** checkbox in header
- **Sync Selected Objects** button
- **Download All Workbooks** for synced objects
- **Refresh Status** to check current state

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- Replaced checkbox list with data table
- Added status badge CSS classes
- Implemented modal for workbook preview
- Added progress tracking for individual objects
- LocalStorage for status persistence

### Backend Endpoints
- `/api/workbook/view?object={apiName}` - Get workbook data
- `/api/workbook/download?object={apiName}` - Download Excel file
- `/api/objects/status` - Get all object sync status

### Sample Data
Currently returns sample data for Product2. Real implementation would:
1. Read from synced workbooks directory
2. Query Salesforce for live data
3. Cache results for performance

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial View**
   - Table shows all objects with current status
   - Previously synced objects show last sync time

2. **Sync Process**
   - Select objects to sync (or use individual sync)
   - Click "Sync Selected Objects"
   - Progress section appears with:
     - Overall progress bar
     - Per-object status and progress
   - Objects update to "synced" status
   - Record counts populate

3. **Viewing Data**
   - Click "View" on any synced object
   - Modal shows data preview
   - Can download from modal or table

4. **Download Options**
   - Individual download per object
   - Bulk download all synced objects
   - Excel format with object name as sheet

## Visual Design
- Consistent with UI style guide
- Professional table styling
- Clear visual feedback for all states
- Responsive layout
- Accessible action links

## Next Steps

1. **Connect to real Salesforce data**
   - Implement actual sync using Salesforce CLI
   - Store workbooks in organized directory structure
   - Track sync history

2. **Add filtering and search**
   - Filter by status
   - Search objects by name
   - Category grouping (Foundation vs Revenue Cloud)

3. **Enhanced workbook viewer**
   - Column sorting
   - Search within data
   - Export selected rows

4. **Sync scheduling**
   - Auto-sync options
   - Sync frequency settings
   - Email notifications

The refactored sync display now provides a professional, user-friendly interface for managing Revenue Cloud data synchronization with clear visual feedback and efficient workflows.
