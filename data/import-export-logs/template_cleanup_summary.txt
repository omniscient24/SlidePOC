    CLEANED TEMPLATE SUMMARY
    ========================
    
    The following changes were made to create a reusable template:
    
    1. Removed all hardcoded Salesforce IDs and replaced with placeholders:
       - PRODUCT_ID_HERE
       - CATEGORY_ID_HERE
       - ATTRIBUTE_ID_HERE
       - PRICEBOOK_ID_HERE
       - etc.
    
    2. Cleared reference fields that point to other records
    
    3. Reset External ID fields to use sequential numbering
    
    4. Reduced example rows in junction object sheets
    
    5. Kept sheet structure and column headers intact
    
    To use this template:
    1. Fill in your actual Salesforce IDs where placeholders exist
    2. Add your product and configuration data
    3. Set appropriate relationships between objects
    4. Import in the correct order (see Instructions sheet)
