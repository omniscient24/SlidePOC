# Salesforce Delete Integration - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Unified Salesforce Service
Created `/app/services/salesforce_service.py` that consolidates all Salesforce operations:

- **Connection Management**: Methods to get/verify active connections
- **Query Operations**: SOQL query execution and object description
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Update, Delete (single and bulk)
- **Product Hierarchy Operations**: Special handling for parent-child relationships
- **Delete with Children**: Smart deletion handling for categories and products

### 2. Backend Integration Updates
Updated `/app/web/server.py` handle_commit_changes() method to:

- Use the new SalesforceService for all operations
- Process field changes with actual Salesforce updates
- Handle deletions with proper parent-child logic
- Return detailed results including deletion details
- Log all operations to change history with status

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### Delete Operations:
- Single record deletion
- Bulk record deletion
- Delete with children (cascade delete)
- Delete with reparenting (move children to new parent)
- Proper error handling for Salesforce constraints

#### Field Updates:
- Update any field on Product2 records
- Proper value type handling (boolean, null, numeric, string)
- Batch processing for multiple changes

#### Error Handling:
- Detailed error messages from Salesforce
- Specific handling for common errors (ENTITY_IS_DELETED, INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS, etc.)
- Transaction-level success/failure tracking

### 4. Testing Considerations
The implementation requires:
- Active Salesforce connection (via SFDX CLI)
- Valid session authentication
- Proper Salesforce permissions for delete operations

## How It Works

1. **UI collects changes** via change-tracker.js
2. **Changes are validated** via /api/edit/changes/validate
3. **Changes are committed** via /api/edit/changes/commit
4. **Backend processes each change**:
   - Field updates use update_record()
   - Deletions use delete_with_children() with smart logic
5. **Results are returned** with details about what succeeded/failed
6. **UI updates** to reflect the committed changes

## Integration Points

The solution reuses existing components:
- ConnectionManager for Salesforce connections
- SyncService for data synchronization
- UploadService for bulk operations
- EditService for change history logging

## Next Steps

To fully test the implementation:
1. Login to the application via the UI
2. Connect to a Salesforce org
3. Navigate to Product Hierarchy
4. Make changes (edit fields, delete nodes)
5. Commit changes to see real Salesforce operations

The backend is now fully integrated and ready to perform actual Salesforce operations!
